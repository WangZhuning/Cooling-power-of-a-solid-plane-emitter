# cooling-power-of-a-solid-plane-emitter
This document presents a theoretical framework for calculating the cooling power of a solid plane emitter, developed on the MATLAB platform
The example file “Case1.m” demonstrates the practical application of this framework, 
while the remaining documents provide encapsulated functions for users to construct their own theoretical models. 

The file “AW1976.mat” includes atmospheric transmittance data based on the US 1976 standard.
